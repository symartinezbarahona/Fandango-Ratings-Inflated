# Capstone Project - Are Fandango's Movie Ratings Inflated? 
## Overview

When planning on seeing a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? What if the online reviewer company showing the rating *also* makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies for the sake of higher profit?

In this capstone project, with the guidance of Jose Portilla, Instructor of 2022 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science, I will explore whether or not Fandango artificially displays higher ratings than warranted to boost ticket sales. Ultimately, the goal is to tell a compelling data-driven story as well as showcase my skills as a python programmer. Hope you enjoy!
